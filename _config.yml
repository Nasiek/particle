user_description: Extremely interested in geospatial technology and software in all of its forms. My main interests are New Urbanism, Transit Oriented Development, data science and software. For fun, I enjoy outdoor recreation such as hiking, biking and trail running, playing scrabble, and concerts. I value making esoteric topics accessible, learning from others' and using my education, skills and experiences to create empathetic  solutions to problems.I am always seeking to improve myself, be more confident, learn from mistakes and be a better planner, programmer and analyst.
