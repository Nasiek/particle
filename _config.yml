user_description: Extremely interested in geospatial technology and software in all of its forms. My academic interests are statistical and object oriented programming, web development, <a style="text-decoration:none; color:#333333" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Urbanism">new urbanism</a>, <a style="text-decoration:none; color:#333333" target="_blank"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit-oriented_development">Transit Oriented Development</a>, and data science. For fun, I enjoy outdoor recreation such as hiking, biking and trail running, playing scrabble, and concerts. I value making esoteric topics accessible, learning from others' and using my education, skills and experiences to create empathetic  solutions to problems. I am always seeking to improve myself, be more confident, learn from mistakes and be a better programmer, planner, and analyst.
