user_description: <div class="about-bl"> <b>Hi!/> Thanks for checking me out! I just graduated from the City and Regional Planning program at the <a class="bottomlink" class="paralinks" href="https://www.design.upenn.edu/city-regional-planning/graduate/work" target="blank">Stuart Weitzman School of Design</a> at Penn. You're probably wondering who I am and what I'm like. I am a designer and data nerd, who is passionate about climate change and sustainability. My goals are to use design, information technology and policy to achieve sustainability targets via the planning process. As you can see I have many interests, and am cultivating an interdisplinary skillset to address them respectively.  <br/><br/> </div><div id="lastp" class="about-bl">For fun, I like hiking, biking and trail running, playing scrabble (former competitive player), and going to local concerts. I'm an avid learner and love a great mind bending problem. I'm really ambitious so naturally I am always improving myself, learning from mistakes and working towards being a better version of myself.
